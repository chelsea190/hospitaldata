Medical Data Interpretation Report
Overview
This project analyzes trends in medical costs and BMI across U.S. demographics to identify cost drivers and opportunities for public health improvement. The dataset includes variables such as weight class, age, gender, smoking status, and geographic region. The goal is to extract actionable insights for healthcare policymakers, insurers, and wellness program designers.

Key Insights
Obesity is a major cost driver, especially in the 26–59 age group.

Slightly above normal weight class showed unexpectedly high costs, possibly due to volume and borderline risk factors.

Regional disparities highlight higher medical costs in the Northeast and Southwest.

Women incur higher total costs, reflecting greater utilization.

BMI increases with age, especially between 32–59, which correlates with higher medical costs.

Implications
Mid-life preventive programs (ages 26–59) offer the highest ROI.

Region-specific strategies can improve public health outcomes cost-effectively.

Gender-specific interventions are needed to support women’s health during reproductive and post-reproductive years.

Recommendations
Launch targeted obesity reduction initiatives.

Tailor public health campaigns by region.

Encourage gender-responsive health programs.

Promote longitudinal BMI tracking to flag early health risks.
